# TurboFood
Turbo Food is an office canteen management system designed to digitalize and streamline the canteen operations across businesses in Bangladesh.

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a structured, scalable, and user-friendly system that eliminates traditional inefficiencies like long queues and manual cash handling. Key features will include role-based access, a digital menu, online ordering, integrated payment processing, and comprehensive reporting for administrators.

The project is built using the ASP.NET Core MVC framework for the backend logic and structure, with SQL Server for database management. The frontend user interface is developed using Blazor for a modern, interactive, and single-page application experience.
